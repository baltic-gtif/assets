# Lithuania High Species Rich Permanent Grassland - Intensity of Management

Natural PGs are ecosystems, where implementation of usual practices consciously adjusted to the actual conditions is able to create a high biodiversity value in a relatively short time-frame. 

The way PGs are maintained by machinery and grazing are serious limiting factors of the ecosystem health. Timing of any activity to be adjusted to climate conditions (wet/dry periods) is essential not to destroy certain vulnerable fauna and herbaceous flora. 

The type and methods as machinery is used, must take into account further parcel specific risks, such as:
- Invasive weed spread (due to existing seed content)
- Type and moisture level of the soil
- Natural seeding period of the advantageous species, etc.

All these factors serve the natural genetic renewal of the herbaceous species.
