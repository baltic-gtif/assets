# Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) - Lithuania
Due to the large root surface and microbial activity, Natural Permanent Grasslands (PG) acts as organic carbon sinks. The intensity and nature of mowing events and livestock grazing critically influence grassland SOC levels. Intensive grazing can lead to significant C losses, while rotational, adaptive grazing can promote plant growth and improve carbon capture and storage in grasslands.
