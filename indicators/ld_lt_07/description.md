## Crop lodging

Crop lodging (i.e. intense bending or even dumping to the ground) is
caused by impacts of severe summer storms, grazing of wild animals or
other mechanical forces damaging the structure of plants and changing
their direction from vertical to horizontal. Most often crop lodging is
causing partial or complete loss of harvest. Crop lodging of cereals
(wheat, rye, barley, oats) were detected in Lithuania during the period
from June 25 till July 15, 2024, i.e. before the harvesting season when
most of lodging events take place, using Sentinel-1 polarimetry SAR data
pre-processed with SAGRIS production system (http://www.sagris.eu).
